## What the skill teaches

An agent pays twice for every clumsy lookup: once for the step itself, and again every time the growing conversation gets re-read. So the skill teaches four habits:

1. **Recon in one pass.** Gather the facts up front in one combined step instead of poking at the repo five separate times. And before copying a format or convention, look at two real examples, not one.
2. **Probe the environment once.** Check every dependency in one command and install whatever is missing in one go, instead of discovering them one crash at a time.
3. **Green means the task's own check.** If the task says how to verify, that command is the definition of done. A missing compiler is still the agent's problem to fix, and a check that fails twice means the approach is wrong, not the symptom. When it passes: stop.
4. **Polling is a step.** A build that hasn't finished has nothing new to say. Check on it every 30 seconds, not every second. On some agent platforms, polling alone turned out to be nearly half of all steps.

The skill's full text: [`RULESET.md`](RULESET.md) (~745 tokens injected).

## What to expect

![Median paired savings across six metrics](assets/savings.svg)

![Token consumption by arm](assets/tokens.svg)

- **Quality unchanged.** 7 better / 5 worse / 68 ties (sign p = 0.77); mean verifier reward 0.362 → 0.392. Not powered as an equivalence test — large effects ruled out, small ones not.
- **Savings scale with baseline bloat.** An identical run a day earlier measured −10.0 % median cost against a leaner-running baseline; the treated arm stayed flat across both days while the control drifted +10.5 %. Expect roughly **−10 % to −18 % cost** depending on how bloated your sessions run.
- **Cross-platform:** on Java SWE-bench (Codex CLI, gpt-5.6-luna, 675 paired replicas) the hook-injected skill measured **−4.4 % cost [−7.5, −1.5], p = 0.003**, solve rate unchanged (p = 0.22), tool calls −20 %.
- Medians are the honest unit: a few hard-task tails can give part of the aggregate back.

## Install — inject it, don't "install" it

Same skill, two delivery methods, tested head-to-head: **injected, it saves** (−17.9 % cost median on the charts above; −4.4 % even on the harder Java/Codex setup) — **as a discoverable skill folder, it saves nothing** (−0.5 %, n.s.; agents burned steps just finding SKILL.md). So: inject.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JetBrains/benjamin-plus-skill ~/.benjamin-plus
```

**Claude Code** — add to `~/.claude/settings.json` (verify with `/hooks`, or just ask Claude Code to add it):

```json
{ "hooks": { "SessionStart": [ { "matcher": "startup|resume|clear|compact",
  "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "cat ~/.benjamin-plus/injected-instruction.md" } ] } ] } }
```

…or per-project, zero config: `cat ~/.benjamin-plus/injected-instruction.md >> CLAUDE.md`

**Codex CLI** — AGENTS.md is loaded into every session; no hook needed:

```bash
cat ~/.benjamin-plus/injected-instruction.md >> ~/.codex/AGENTS.md   # or >> AGENTS.md in a repo
```

**Any other agent** — append `injected-instruction.md` to the system prompt. That's the whole integration (~3 KB).

## How it was measured

This skill wasn't written once and shipped. It came out of **auto research**: an agent working in a loop against the benchmark. Mine ~1,200 old agent traces for where the money actually goes, draft rules, run a paired A/B, read the failing trajectories, revise, run again. Six versions later, only the rules that survived the evidence were left. Everything that traded quality for savings got deleted along the way, which turned out to be most of the clever ideas.

The measurement itself is a paired A/B. Same agent, same model, same tasks, same container images; the only difference between the arms is the injected skill text. 80 paired SkillsBench tasks (Claude Code 2.1.201 in Docker sandboxes, Sonnet 5, low effort), Wilcoxon on the paired deltas, a sign test on rewards, and a per-trial adoption check: the payload reached the model in 80 of 80 treated runs and 0 of 80 controls. Trials that failed on one side only were retried before anything was counted. Every number and caveat lives in [`EXPECTED-RESULTS.md`](EXPECTED-RESULTS.md).

## Feedback

Found a regression, a workload where it loses money, or a rule that misfires on your stack? [Open an issue](../../issues) — ideally with the paired numbers (with/without) and, if you can, a trace. Results from other benchmarks and harnesses are especially welcome; that's how v6 got its polling rule.
